# E-Commerce Website | [Run4It](https://run4it.herokuapp.com/)
This project is an e-commerce website centered around athletic apparel. It contains three pages routed together through react. The home page has slider images. The product page contains products, pulled from a MongoDB database, that allows a user to filter by product type and price. The contact page has a form that dynamically adds the comment to the comment slider so users can see their comments. A secure admin page has been added that allows access to the products. React and MongoDB is linked together through Express.

## Getting Started

1. Use `npm install` to install all needed dependencies as listed by the package.json.

2. Run `mongod` to start the MongoDB process and run it in the background.

3. Create a `.env` in both the root directory and the test directory. The `.env` in the test directory should contain a different port for the tests.

4. Use `npm start` to start the application from the root directory.
